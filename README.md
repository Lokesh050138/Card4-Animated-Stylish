## Animated Stylish Card4 - Card4.html

This repository contains `Card4.html`, a dynamic and visually appealing HTML file that showcases an animated card with multiple stylish effects and animations.

### Features

- **Floating Animation**: The card gently floats up and down, creating a subtle movement that draws the userâ€™s attention. This animation is achieved using the `@keyframes` CSS rule.
  
- **3D Transformations and Hover Effects**: On hover, the card rotates slightly along the Y-axis and lifts off the screen, creating a 3D visual effect. Additionally, the card's background transitions to a gradient color, enhancing the hover interaction.

- **Animated Text and Elements**:
  - **Header Elements**: The header's large "01" number slides in from the left, and the "Happy Birthday!" text fades in with a delay, providing a sequential entrance effect.
  - **Body Content**: The body text smoothly slides up into view, giving a clean and modern animation feel.
  - **Button Animations**: The "Read More" button has a pulsing animation that scales it up and down continuously, drawing the user's focus. On hover, the button changes color and lifts slightly.

- **CSS Animations**: The card makes extensive use of CSS animations to create a variety of effects, such as `slideInLeft`, `fadeIn`, `slideInUp`, `scaleIn`, and `pulse`. These animations help create a more engaging and interactive experience for the user.

- **Smooth Transitions**: All animations and hover effects are designed with smooth transitions, enhancing the overall user experience and ensuring that the animations do not feel abrupt or jarring.

- **Modern and Responsive Design**: The card is styled with modern aesthetics, including rounded corners, box shadows, and gradient backgrounds. The layout is responsive, with the card centered on the page using Flexbox, ensuring it looks great on any device.
